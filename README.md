# Stream Code

 ðŸš€ Welcome to the official GitHub repository of Stream Code, a cutting-edge, real-time collaborative code editor built using React, Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. Stream Code allows multiple users to interact and edit code simultaneously in a seamless and efficient manner.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Synchronize code edits live with other users, enhancing teamwork and productivity.
- **Room Management:** Users can create, join, and leave rooms to organize collaboration sessions effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stream-code.git
   cd stream-code
2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   For the frontend:
   ```bash
   # Copy code
   npm install
  
3. Running the Application

   Start the Frontend:
     ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the frontend directory
    npm start
    
  This command starts the React application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
 
4. Start the Backend:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the frontend directory
    npm run server:dev
    
 This will launch the Node.js/Express server on http://localhost:3001 (or your configured port), which handles real-time communication via Socket.io.
